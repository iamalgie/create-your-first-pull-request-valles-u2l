Expectations in CMSC 100:
  I held high expectations for this course, as Web Programming is a discipline within
  computer science that I hold in high regard, alongside Data Science. I have heard
  that this is considered one of the more challenging subjects for sophomore comsci
  students. I am also anticipating that the lab professor will impart their knowledge
  and strategies to facilitate a smoother understanding of the course. Thus, I am looking
  forward to enjoy this course as I progress.
